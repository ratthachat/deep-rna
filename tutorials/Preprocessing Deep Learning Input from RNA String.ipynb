    "# 1. Why bother with RNA properties prediction?\n",
    "\n",
    "RNA Technology is now a new promising hope in Health Science. In addtion to the global-scaled use of COVID19 mRNA-vaccines from BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna, RNA drugs also provides [a new hint on how to cure important disease such as cancers](https://jhoonline.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13045-020-00951-w).\n",
    "\n",
    "Serious learners about RNA should take this [amazing course](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-biology-the-secret-of-life-3), or just look at this [cute video](https://youtu.be/JQByjprj_mA) (and the others in this channel) if you don't have much time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Leading labs including [BioNTech](https://biontech.de/how-we-translate/mrna-therapeutics), [Moderna](https://www.modernatx.com/mrna-technology/mrna-platform-enabling-drug-discovery-development) and [others](https://www.accenttx.com/our-scientific-focus/rmps-and-cancer/) state that RNA-related technology has an important advantage over DNA-technology such that it will not provide a **permanent effects** on a patient, i.e. if we modify our genes in DNA, the modification will permanently embed in the DNA, including any modification mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, injected RNA will do its job i.e. making protiens, and then completely disappeared, without leaving any permanent effects. Proteins made by RNA could prevent some\n",
    "important diseases such as in the case of mRNA vaccines. Intuitively, Moderna compares DNA as a life \"hardware\" while RNA as a \"software\" which can be safely injected to human body.\n",
    "\n",
    "To design RNA drug or vaccine, some properties of RNA must be known. In the past, these properties have to be tested in bio labs which can be time and resource consuming.\n",
    "Therefore, it is difficult to conduct experiments in a large scale e.g. millions of RNAs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning technology then can help predicting specific properties of millions of RNAs in a flash. Even though, its predictions are not entirely 100% accurate, it can serve as a first filter\n",
    "for biologists to select most promising samples to further make a small-scale intensive case in the next phase.\n",

    "## 1.1 About this Tutorial\n",
    "This interactive tutorial notebook demonstrates how to preprocess RNA data into an input ready to feed into Deep Learning models.\n",
    "The processed data will be similar to the ones provided by [Kaggle's mRNA OpenVaccine competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/stanford-covid-vaccine/overview).\n",
    "So that once you finish processing your own RNA data, you can use any of the [great public codes](https://www.kaggle.com/c/stanford-covid-vaccine/code?competitionId=22111&sortBy=voteCount) \n",
    "to make a prediction. We will provide a simplified SOTA top-solution, which will be easily reproducible and adapt to your own work in the near future, so stay tune!!\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1 shows the overall big picture of this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we assume that the user has a list of \"RNA strings\" as input where an RNA string is a string consisting of only 4 characters 'ACGU'.\n",
    "The true RNA structure of a given string is unknown as can be illustrated in Figure 1 (bottom-left).\n",
    "The user wants to extract this unknown structure and represents it in the format which is ready-to-use on a Deep Learning model, e.g. a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, this unknown structure will be estimated using various python and bioinformatics libraries. \n",
    "To feed into a deep learning model, the estimated structure will be best represented by \"Graph data\" $G = (X, E)$ where\n",
    "each node in the graph corresponding to each character in a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this **Graph Representation** generalizes **Sequential Data Representation** so while you can still use well-known\n",
    "sequential layers/models such as '1D Convolution', 'Transformers' or 'Recurrent Neural Networks', you can also use a new frontier\n",
    "like 'Graph Neural Networks' which is actually shown effective in this RNA data.\n",
    "\n",
    "$X$ is a sequence of **node feature vectors**,\n",
    "and $E$ is an adjacency matrix specifying linkages for each pair of nodes whether the pair is connected in the true structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, each element in an adjacency matrix can be a real number (e.g. specifying a \"probability\" whether a pair is connected).\n",
    "Moreover, there can be more than one adjacency matrices (e.g. differently estimated from various libraries). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this general setting of having a list of several adjacency matrices, we will shortly call $E$ as a list of **edge features**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Acknowledgement** this tutorial is built on amazing works of many kagglers especially [@its7171](https://www.kaggle.com/its7171/how-to-generate-augmentation-data) and [@group16](https://www.kaggle.com/group16/generating-bpps-with-arnie). However, the URLs and packages used in their notebooks are already outdated. This tutorial fix the problems, ensure complete reproducibility using static Kaggle's dataset, as well as providing full detailed explanation with minimum requirements on the input data.\n"

    "## 1.1 Overview of this tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "We will assume that users have already list of RNA strings to extract the graph features explained above. Here, we will use Kaggle's OpenVaccine dataset containing 6,000 RNA strings. Note that in OpenVaccine, the dataset already contained some of node and edge features. We will not use them in this tutorial but will show how to extract features even beyond ones in OpenVaccine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Node Features.** Each character in an RNA string is represented by its character \"A, C, G or U\" and its loop-type as shown in Figure 1 \"Exterior, Bulge, Stem, Multibranch or Hairpin\". We will represent each character by 1-hot vector $R^4$ and will represent the loop-type vector in $R^6$ since there are 6 possible loop types. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that RNA structure can be very complex and have a wide variety as shown in Figure 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.ibb.co/swD1DBF/rna-folding-examples.png)\n",
    "Figure 2. RNA can have a variety of structure due to folding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, due to complexity of the RNA folding structure, exact loop-type property is unknown (already mentioned in Figure 1), the `CapR` library we used can estimate loop-type probability. Therefore, it will return a probability vector in $R^6$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, by concatenating the two vectors, our node features will lies in $R^{10}$. Note that it's certainly possible that to also employ other libraries to extract more node features so that our node-feature vector lies in a higher dimensional than $R^{10}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Edge Features.** Similar to loop-type features, exact link between a pair of nodes is unknown. Therefore, **\"base-pair probabilities matrix (bpps)\"** is extracted instead. Suppose that an RNA string is length of $N$, bpps then is in $R^{N \\times N}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial show how to extract edge features using bpps libraries such as `vienna`, `contrafold` and `rnastructure`. From bpps of these libraries, we can also get \"most probable\" structure, which can also be further extracted as either node or edge feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the node and edge features are extracted, they can be input directly to deep learning models as shown in Figure 3. The RNA Deep Learning notebook tutorial will be published soon.\n",
