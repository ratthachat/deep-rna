# Spektral
This is a minimal adoption from the amazing [Spektral Project](https://github.com/danielegrattarola/spektral) to make BatchLoader be able to handle arbitrary RNA sequences with any lengths.
Also, the loader can handle "node classification" or "RNA-base prediction" problems which is not possible in original Spektral repository.
